#This is not the most elegant code, and the code for other methods is a bit messy. The code in python is coded more elegantly in https://github.com/AlexImmer/loci and in R in https://github.com/tagas/bQCD
#If you want to replicate results from Section 6.2, follow these steps:

#First, download bQCD-master.zip and set directory to the extracted file
#Second, run data_generators.txt
#Third, download loci-master.zip from https://github.com/AlexImmer/loci (too big to upload here the zip file)
#Next, in order to run the codes coded in python, open a python modul, set directory to loci-master.zip and run the following

from causa.datasets import AN, LS, MNU, SIMG, ANs, CausalDataset, Tuebingen, SIM, LSs
from causa.heci import HECI
from causa.loci import loci

#Next, open baselines.txt and run it
#finally, open Simulations 2.txt and run that file
