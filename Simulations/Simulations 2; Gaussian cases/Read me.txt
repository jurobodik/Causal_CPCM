#If you want to replicate results from Section 6.2 in the manuscript, follow these steps:
#Note: you can skip steps 4 and 5 (and skip lines 30-33 in baselines.txt) if you dont need to run in-python-coded algorithms LOCI and HECI.

#First, open CPCM.txt file and run the file (it contains CPCM function)
#Second, download bQCD-master.zip and set directory to the extracted file
#Third, run data_generators.txt
#Fourth, download loci-master.zip from https://github.com/AlexImmer/loci (too big to upload here the zip file)
#Fifth, in order to run the codes coded in python, open a python modul, set directory to loci-master.zip and run the following chuck of code:

from causa.datasets import AN, LS, MNU, SIMG, ANs, CausalDataset, Tuebingen, SIM, LSs
from causa.heci import HECI
from causa.loci import loci

#Sixth, open baselines.txt and run it
#finally, open Simulations 2.txt and run it


#Note: this is not the most elegant code, and the code for other methods is a bit messy. The code in python is coded more elegantly in https://github.com/AlexImmer/loci and in R in https://github.com/tagas/bQCD
