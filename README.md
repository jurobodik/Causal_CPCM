# Causal_CPCM
Supplementary package for the paper "Identifiability of causal graphs under nonadditive conditionally parametric models". It contains the code for causal graph estimation via CPCM (the main code of the function "CPCM_graph_estimate" is in a separate file), the code for the silumations and the code+data for the application.
